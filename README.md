This career path goal was to become a job-ready frontend developer in less than six months.

The curriculum is curated by Mozilla MDN to ensure that it always aligns with the latest industry standards and best practices for modern frontend development, as outlined in their MDN Curriculum. It is based on extensive research into what new hires need to know to succeed in the industry.

I've earned a well-rounded skill set balanced between modern tooling such as React and GitHub, and evergreen best practices such as semantic HTML, JavaScript fundamentals, and accessibility.

I've also built more than a dozen portfolio projects, and solve 100s of interactive coding challenges.
